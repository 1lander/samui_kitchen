## Our Journey

Samui Kitchen was founded in 2010 by Chef Somchai and his wife Malai, who moved from Koh Samui, Thailand to bring authentic Thai flavors to our city. What started as a small family-run takeaway has grown into one of the most beloved Thai restaurants in the area.

Our journey began with a simple mission: to share the rich culinary heritage of Thailand through dishes that are prepared with traditional techniques and the freshest ingredients. Over the years, we've stayed true to this mission while expanding our menu and services to better serve our community.
